                <blockquote>
                <p>Late medieval Eastern Europe was awash with kingdoms
                and cultures all but lost to the popular imagination:
                German holy warriors, Norse merchant-kings, Muslim
                mystics, Jewish khans, and pagan gods. The history of
                this time and place did not leave much in the way of an
                integrated body of scholarship, which makes our task
                both more interesting and more challenging. Our approach
                will be ‚Äúprimary sources first‚Äù: we will read a wide
                variety of texts (in translation) left by the Rus, the
                Teutonic Order, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and
                the nomads of the steppe and pragmatically draw upon
                what little scholarship exists to make sense of them as
                we proceed. Themes that will emerge from these texts are
                wide-ranging, from religion (conversion to Christianity,
                Islam, and Judaism) to political (competing strategies
                of empire-building) to cultural (the transregional
                Byzantine ‚Äúcosmopolis‚Äù). Over the course of the
                semester, students will develop an original research
                paper based on assigned primary source readings
                integrated into the body of scholarship we assembled
                together.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
                <p>Baltic crusades? Italian city-states? Jewish
                khanates? And that‚Äôs before we even get to the
                <em>slightly</em> better-known stories of
                Poland-Lithuania and the Rus. Medieval Eastern Europe is
                not a coherent area study: it is an arena. There is no
                textbook or even cohesive body of scholarship that can
                guide us through this complexity. Thus, our approach in
                this Capstone seminar is going to work outward from the
                primary sources: we will (slowly and carefully) read a
                range of historical sources from a diverse set of
                cultural groups and attempt to answer the questions and
                challenges that emerge by assembling our own collective
                bibliography of secondary scholarship.</p>

                Contract Grading</h3>
                <p>This class will be subject to <em>‚Äúcontract
                grading‚Äù</em>: at the beginning of the semester, you
                will choose a workload category corresponding to a
                letter grade at the end of the semester. Thus, rather
                than a grade exclusively evaluating the <em>quality</em>
                of a uniform set of assignments, your grade will be
                primarily based on labor input. Within each grade
                category, pluses and minuses are subject to instructor
                discretion based on quality and effort.</p>
                <p>You are all history majors and I take it for granted
                that, having gotten this far, you are motivated and
                fully capable of producing quality historical
                scholarship. There is no shame in selecting a lower
                workload for the semester: we all have competing
                priorities.</p>

                <h3 id="the-research-project">The Research Project</h3>
                <p>The centerpiece of a Capstone seminar is an
                independent research project. The starting point for
                each project will be the common primary source reading
                for one of the thematic units in the course. Think of
                this pre-selected reading as a ‚Äúthread‚Äù you will pull on
                to unravel a much larger tapestry of related sources and
                secondary scholarship that will substantiate your
                research project. As you read the pre-selected source
                closely, what questions emerge? How have historians made
                sense of the source in the past? What are the major
                debates? What other primary sources help contextualize
                it? How does it relate to the other thematic units in
                the course?</p>
                <h3 id="mini-presentations">Mini-Presentations</h3>
                <p>Students will sign up for mini-presentations
                throughout the semester. These are meant to be low-key
                and low-stress: no more than 10 minutes, visuals
                optional. These presentations come in several different
                flavors:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><em>Historical narrative</em>: What, like, happened?
                Tell the story of the thematic unit: major turning
                points; key figures; cultural milestones. Pretend like
                you are a director adapting the material for a
                historical epic: try to make it exciting.</li>
                <li><em>Historiography</em>: To the extent there is an
                identifiable historiography (many of these themes are
                niche at best), what are the major interpretive
                debates?</li>
                <li><em>Primary sources</em>: What are some of the other
                available sources that help shed light on our common
                reading? Do they fall into different categories (e.g.,
                by language or time period)? If you can get your hands
                on some of them, read a few quotes to offer the class
                texture.</li>
                <li><em>Student-led reading</em>: Pick a section of the
                common reading <em>other</em> than the assigned sections
                and lead the class through it. Why did you pick this
                section? What questions does it raise? How does it
                relate to (or not) to the sections we read
                together?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="perusall">Perusall</h3>
                <p>We will read sections of the assigned sources
                together using Perusall, software that allows us to
                comment on the texts together between classes.</p>

                <p>Throughout the semester, we will be assembling a
                historiography for our subjectmatter together as a
                group. You are all responsible for contributing
                citations to the shared Zotero library (you can access
                the library, and request to join, <a

                this link</a>). These must be thoughtful, careful
                submissions:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>You may copy the citation information from an online
                repository (e.g., using the Zotero browser extension),
                but must double-check the bibliographic information for
                completeness and correctness.</li>
                <li>You must manually add at least three tags.</li>
                <li>You must add a note to the citation: 3-4 sentences
                informally describing what the work or source is, how
                you found it, and why it might be useful.</li>
