                <h4 id="course-objective">Course Objective</h4>
                <p>This course seeks to impart an understanding of the
                Islamic tradition by exploring the religion’s formative
                period. The first centuries of Islam are fascinating for
                many of the same reasons they are complex and even
                controversial: our primary sources are fragmented,
                partisan, and often retrospective; a tremendous range of
                voices competed to define the new religion; and nearly
                all subsequent Muslim thinkers would harken back to this
                period to legitimize their own positions. In other
                words, the history of the formation of Islam remains
                dynamic, charged, and relevant to the present day. We
                will endeavor to develop an understanding of the
                diversity of voices in this early period and consider
                why certain conceptualizations of theology, law, and
                philosophy displaced others; and then follow those
                voices beyond the Arabian origins of the new religion to
                examine its manifestation in the North African and
                Central / South Asian borderlands.</p>
                <h4 id="organization-of-course-content">Organization of
                Course Content</h4>
                <p>The course integrates two intertwined themes: (1)
                early Islamic empires as geopolitical formations; and
                (2) the development of ideas within the religious
                tradition. We will begin by spending significant time on
                the pre-Islamic period, examining both imperial and
                theological continuities between late antiquity and
                Islam. Then we will follow one of the fastest expanding
                empires in world history as the early Islamic polity
                advanced of the Arabian Peninsula. Simultaneously, we
                will consider the development of Islamic scripture
                (Qur’an and Hadith), early theological disputes,
                scientific advancement, and the consolidation of a legal
                tradition. The course concludes on the eve of the Mongol
                conquests, as the vague outlines of something resembling
                a cultural-religious consensus become discernable.</p>
                <h4 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h4>
                <p>The principle learning outcomes of this course are
                twofold:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li>Ability to deploy original analysis through the
                engagement of primary sources</li>
                <li>The articulation of that analysis through
                evidence-based writing</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Both of these skills are developed in view of
                applying them beyond the academic field of history.</p>

                <p>Learning to write persuasive, evidence-based essays
                is a major emphasis of this course. If you wish to
                receive feedback on your writing in advance of the
                formal essays, you are invited (but not required) to
                complete a cumulative series of mini-writing assignments
                designed to prepare you for the midterm and final paper.
                This three-part sequence is recommended, but entirely
                optional (though it will result in a modest extra credit
                bonus to the Midterm Essay category of your total
                grade).</p>
                <h4 id="extra-credit-opportunities">Extra Credit
                Opportunities</h4>
                <p>There will be numerous opportunities for extra credit
                (in the Participation category) throughout the semester.
                We are fortunate that Pitt hosts all sorts of
                interesting speakers relevant to course themes, which
                offers the potential to dramatically enrich your overall
                course experience. Generally, extra credit entails
                attending a university lecture and writing a short
                reflection relating the content to course themes (no
                more than a page). You are welcome to suggest extra
                credit assignments to me, as long as you do so at least
                three days in advance of the event itself, so that your
                colleagues also have the opportunity to attend.</p>

                Canvas cutoffs, with one exception: only the highest two
                overall grades are eligible for an “A+”; other grades
                within the standard A+ range will be collapsed into the
                “A” category.</p>
                <h4 id="study-guides-and-participation">Study Guides and
                Participation</h4>
                <p>If you complete most of the exercises (80% or
                higher), you will receive full credit (i.e., bumped up
                to 100%) in these categories; below 80% you will receive
                the raw score. If you have any questions or concerns
                about your participation grade, please discuss with the
                instructor during <em>office hours only</em>.</p>

                Work</h4>
                <p>Everyone has hectic, challenging schedules, and
                unexpected hardships during the semester are a
                near-certainty. These course policies build in
                substantial flexibility for exactly that reason. If you
                miss an assignment, or cannot make it to a class, there
                are already systems in place to accommodate; nine times
                out of ten you will not need to get in touch with me
                separately. For extreme circumstances in which you
                require accommodations beyond the standard ones detailed
                below, I will require a note from your advisor.</p>

                <p>No religion or culture comes out of nowhere fully
                formed – so what did the Middle East look like before
                Islam? What did the religious landscape look like in the
                Byzantine (Roman) and Persian empires? Which imperial
                traditions were already available for early Islamic
                empires to draw upon? How do we understand Christianity
                and Judaism during this time period, and what was
                Zoroastrianism?</p>

                remembered as the high point of Islamic civilization?
                Was it significant that the capital moved from Damascus
                to Baghdad? Who were the non-Muslims, and how did they
                relate to the new cultural-imperial system?</p>

                we understand the emergent Persian cultural influence
                during this period? And what is Islamic mysticism
                (Sufism)?</p>
