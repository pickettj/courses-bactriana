<h1 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>The ultimate goal of this course is to develop <em>critical thinking
skills</em> and <em>habits of mind</em> for evaluating the relationship
between primary sources (data), fact, and analytical implications: How
do we know what we think we know? What is a fact? When everyone has an
opinion, what is the difference between a more compelling and less
compelling argument?</p>
<p>This may seem vague, and to some degree this is what all humanities
courses purport to do. What about the “hard skills” you can put on your
resume?</p>
<h2 id="analytical-writing">Analytical Writing</h2>
<p>Reports of the demise of analytical writing are greatly exaggerated:
for all the ways AI is reshaping the way we write (see below), your
ability to draw upon facts to advance an argument-driven interpetation
of those facts (in print or out loud; in an academic essay or on social
media; to a friend or to your supervisor) is more valuable than ever
before.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-stuff">“Knowing Stuff”</h2>
<p>Can you name all of the US state capitals? Your p̶a̶r̶e̶n̶t̶s̶ grandparents
probably could, or memorized them in school. As more and more
information is at our disposal on our smartphones, less and less of it
is readily available in our heads. For the most part, that is as it
should be: pedagogy evolves along with our tools.</p>
<p>However… it is still important to have some baseline of knowledge in
your active memory. Even though you can look up a fact in a matter of
seconds, in practice much of the time you will not do so: when you are
chatting on the phone, as you quickly peruse an article, when you don’t
know what you don’t know. The facts at your immediate disposal in your
active memory shape your understanding of the world around you even when
you don’t realize it.</p>
<p>Therefore, you will be expected to learn some stuff — even (gasp)
memorize a few big-picture facts — relevant to the subjectmatter of this
course.</p>
