<h1>Email Etiquette</h1><a href="index.html" class="back-link">← Back to Index</a>
<p>From your perspective, email probably feels boring and antiquated. But most of your instructors are GenX and Millennials, which means they can (<em>almost</em>) remember when email was new and exciting. In any case, Pitt gave you each <span class="citation" data-cites="pitt.edu">@pitt.edu</span> email accounts for a reason: promptly responding to communication from your official account is a <em>course requirement</em>, not just a courtesy.</p>
<p>And it is important to give <em>good</em> email. At a bare minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a clear subject line.
<ul>
<li>For instance, it is helpful to include course number and topic (e.g., “HIST 0753: Question about Assignment 2”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open with a stodgy, formal greeting: “Dear <a href="https://community-sitcom.fandom.com/wiki/Sean_Garrity">Professor Professorson</a>”
<ul>
<li>“Hello Professor Professorson,” “Greetings,” etc., is probably okay… but avoid “Hey dude.”</li>
<li><em>Pro-tip</em>: if your instructor (or boss) responds to your salutation with their first name, you can address them that way going forward. (Remember: your instructors are ̶i̶̶n̶̶s̶̶e̶̶c̶̶u̶̶r̶̶e̶̶ ̶a̶̶n̶̶d̶̶ ̶v̶̶a̶̶i̶̶n̶̶ justifiably proud of the achievements that earned them that doctorate, so err on the side of caution until they indicate otherwise.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remind your instructor who you are: e.g., “I’m <a href="https://community-sitcom.fandom.com/wiki/Abed_Nadir">Abed Nadir</a> from your Tuesday/Thursday HIST 0753 ‘Conspiracy Theories &amp; Interior Design’ class.”
<ul>
<li>Your instructors are interacting with hundreds of students each day. Plus they are old and broken and their backs hurt. Do them this kindness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>State your purpose clearly, getting to the point immediately.
<ul>
<li>It should be clear just from scanning through the email what the “ask” is, what the associated deadlines are, whether this is a time-sensitive email or one that can wait until the weekend.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wrap it up professionally: “Best regards,” “Thank you,” “Sincerely.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Other considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always, <em>always</em> acknowledge an email sent to you by an instructor, especially if it addressed you directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be a quick “understood!”; but if you do not respond, you’ve added a new item to your instructor’s already very full to-do list.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Responding within 24 hours is “delightfully prompt”; within 48 hours is “on time”; and 72 hours or more is “delinquent.”</p></li>
<li><p>Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t email the way you text: these are different mediums. No emails that are all lower case, no emojis, and, for the love of god, no gifs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Subject: HIST 1287: &quot;Nicolas Cage: Good or Bad?&quot;&quot; - Extra Credit Opportunity Question

Dear Professor Duncan,

My name is Annie Edison, and I&#39;m in your Monday/Wednesday &quot;Nicolas Cage: 
Good or Bad?&quot; seminar. I&#39;m preparing my final argumentative essay (currently 
at 47 pages, but I can trim it down), and I wanted to ask: does citing 
National Treasure 2 count as a primary or secondary source?

Also, I noticed the syllabus mentions a possible extra credit opportunity for 
attending a Nic Cage film festival. I&#39;ve already purchased tickets to all 
seven screenings and prepared comparative viewing notes. Should I submit 
those separately, or incorporate them into my final thesis defense?

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to our class debate on Thursday!

Best regards,
Annie Edison  
Sophomore, Pre-Law  </code></pre>
