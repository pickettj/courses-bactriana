<h1>Citation Management Tools</h1><a href="index.html" class="back-link">← Back to Index</a>
<p>In a sense, the citation is the most fundamental truth claim that the
historian makes: we agree that this object exists in the world.
Interpretations will differ radically, but the citation establishes
agreement that we (the writer and the readers) are on the same page.</p>
<p>The best way to keep track of <em>your</em> citations (e.g., books
assigned in class, documents you found on an archival website for a
research project, articles turned up in a literature review, etc.) is <a
href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>: a free, open source citation
management tool. Zotero is strongly recommended for all of my classes
and required for some of them.</p>
<h2 id="zotero-tutorials">Zotero Tutorials</h2>
<p>Zotero is a popular tool, which means there are <a
href="https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide">plenty of
resources</a> available for learning to use it properly. In brief: the
application <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/">you download</a>
lives on your hard drive and you populate it with citations yourself.
This “master” application allows you to quickly search and filter
through all of the citations you have added to the local citation
database.</p>
<p>Most people also use a browser extension (available for most web
browsers, including <a
href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en">Chrome</a>,
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/">Firefox</a>, and <a
href="https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/safari_compatibility">Safari</a>).
The extension simply “copies” data from an online repository to your
local Zotero database. If the PittCat (or Amazon, or Google, or the
Library of Congress) made any mistakes entering the bibliographic <a
href="https://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/setting-the-stage/">metadata</a>,
those mistakes will be reproduced on your local Zotero database.</p>
<p>The next piece of the puzzle is the <a
href="https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_installation">word
processor plugin</a>, which may be automatically installed in Microsoft
Word when you install Zotero (and there are plugins for other popular
software, like Google Documents). This plugin saves you <em>a lot</em>
of time properly formatting citations for a paper, or switching between
citation schemas if need be.</p>
<p>Zotero also has extension. An especially useful one is <a
href="https://github.com/wileyyugioh/zotmoov">ZotMoov</a>, which will
automatically rename PDFs and e-books based on Zotero citation data and
move them to a folder of your choosing.</p>
<p>Finally, Zotero has a “social network” dimension in the form of cloud
storage and “<a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/groups">Zotero
Groups</a>,” i.e. shared libraries. Some classes use this feature for
class assignments, which brings us to…</p>
<h2 id="zotero-groups-shared-libraries-for-course-assignments">Zotero
“Groups” (Shared Libraries) for Course Assignments</h2>
<p>If you are participating in a collaborative bibliography building
exercise, please abide by the following guidelines:</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-citation">Getting the citation</h3>
<p>Always, always, always manually double check the citation information
by looking at the <em>original source</em>. This means that if you used
a browser extension to save yourself some time (not only fine, but
recommended), you still have to proofread the copied citational
information carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will almost always leave some fields blank (e.g., not all books
are part of a series, which means the “series” field will often be
blank). However, title, author name, publisher, and date <em>at a bare
minimum</em> should always be there.</li>
<li>“<a
href="https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/item_types_and_fields">Item
type</a>” is a critical field to get right because this governs what
other fields are available: what Zotero understands to be a book will
have different available fields than, say, an audio recording (which
will have fields like “running time” not applicable to a book).
<ul>
<li>A common pitfall when using a browser extension is copying citation
information from a webpage that Zotero does not recognize as containing
bibliographic data, which means the citation will be copied as a website
citation (a valid Item type, but probably not the one you are looking
for).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>
<p>Once you have the basic bibligraphic metadata correct, it is time to
consider <em>organization</em>. Zotero organizes citation data by <a
href="https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags">“collections”
and “tags”</a> — concepts you are likely familiar with from other
contexts. Collections are a bit more like folders (though
non-hierarchical, i.e. a citation can be in multiple collections at the
same time) and represent a higher level of organization than tags (which
work the same way they do on social media, more or less). The instructor
will create collections: it is your job to decide which ones your shared
citation should be added to. The tags are up to you, but put some
thought into it. Tags that others have already used will be more useful,
for instance. More specific tags will narrow down search results more,
but are not very useful if they are so specific that they only apply to
one entry.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>Once you have the data correct, and after you have ensured that the
citation is organized properly so that your colleagues can find it, now
it is time to think about documentation. At the very least, you must <a
href="https://www.zotero.org/support/notes">attach <em>one note</em></a>
to any citation you add. This note can be brief — a sentence, a short
paragraph — but should offer some basic information about why you think
the source or work you added is useful. For instance: “according to this
review by Professor Professorson, this is the most important article
about X or Y.”</p>
<p>You should also consider adding other attachments for greater
context, such as URL links. For instance, if you originally learned
about the citation you added from the footnotes of a Wikipedia article,
why not attach a link to the referring article? (I.e., your citation
object in Zotero would still be to the source itself, but you can add a
link to as many websites or files as you like.)</p>
<p>Think of this step (along with the tags) as a “bread crumb trail”:
you want to make sure your colleguages (not to mention your future self)
can readily retrace your steps to figure out where the citation came
from and why it is important.</p>
