<h1>Study Guides</h1><a href="index.html" class="back-link">← Back to Index</a>
<p>You are expected to complete a study guide associated with each class session, due one hour after class (with a built in grace period of a few hours). The study guides can be found on TopHat.</p>
<p>These study guides integrate material from both the lectures and required readings. It is recommended that you keep the study guide open and work through it as you read assigned texts and participate in lecture. Complete all of the questions you in advance that you can based on the readings alone; and then keep the questions you can’t answer in mind so that you can fill in those gaps during the lecture. The study guides are open-book, and you are more than welcome to work collaboratively with your peers, consult the instructor during office hours, or raise your hand during class.</p>
<p>If you do the readings and listen to the lectures carefully, it is very feasible to get a perfect score in the study guide grade category. Most questions will award points both for correctness and participation. Scores above 80% will be rounded up to full credit, so please do not contact the instructor if you need to miss a class or have a technical difficulty submitting one assignment: you are already covered.</p>
<p>This format of assignment was designed in response to <em>student demand</em>: they are meant to help you integrate the complex material spread over lectures, textbook, and primary sources.</p>
