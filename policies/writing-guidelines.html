<h1>Writing Guidelines</h1><a href="index.html" class="back-link">← Back to Index</a>
<p>An analytical essay should consist of an introductory paragraph,
clearly defined body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph. The
introductory paragraph should contain a <a
href="https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/developing-thesis">thesis</a>
(i.e. overarching argument) broad enough to encapsulate the subtopics of
the body paragraphs, but narrow enough that someone could potentially
disagree. Each body paragraph should introduce a sub-argument
complementary to the larger thesis in the form of a topic sentence, as
well as a concluding sentence <a
href="https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/transitioning-beware-velcro">bridging
into the next body paragraph</a>. The <a
href="https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/ending-essay-conclusions">concluding
paragraph</a> should recapitulate the thesis, and perhaps also <a
href="https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/counter-argument">anticipate
potential criticisms</a>.</p>
<p>Essays will be evaluated first and foremost based on structure,
argumentation, and evidence. Style will also be considered as a
secondary criterion. Particularly if you have limited experience with
analytical writing, it will be helpful to <a
href="https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/outlining">outline</a>
in advance, <a
href="https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/ModelPapers#History">consult model
esssays</a>, read the essay outloud to yourself, and have classmates
review it before submission. The <a
href="http://www.writingcenter.pitt.edu/.">Writing Center</a> is another
important resource.</p>
<p>Please keep the following principles in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any factual statements must be accompanied by a proper citation,
e.g.: (Radishchev, 63).
<ul>
<li>You are encouraged to use footnotes with the full reference
apparatus using the <a
href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/turabian/Student-Tip-Sheets.html">Chicago
Manual of Style</a> (especially if you are a history major). However,
simple parenthetical references are acceptable so long as they contain
the page number and it is clear which assigned reading you are
referencing.</li>
<li>Cite the <em>original</em> page number of the publication, not the
pdf page number, whenever possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prioritize citing primary sources, then secondary works, then
textbooks, then lectures, in that order.
<ul>
<li>You may also cite lectures using the following format: (Lecture
4.1).</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a valid source for this exercise (even though it
can be an invaluable resource in other contexts), nor are any other
websites.</li>
<li>You may reference outside readings, but they are not a substitute
for assigned readings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep in mind that in addition to writing a strong essay for its own
sake, you are also illustrating your mastery of material covered over
the course of the semester. Therefore, it is important to engage with a
<em>diverse</em> array of sources.</li>
<li><a
href="https://withoutbullshit.com/blog/10-top-writing-tips-psychology">Write
clearly, avoid jargon, frontload key insights</a>.
<ul>
<li>Define your terms clearly (and without quoting the dictionary).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The thesis should do more than simply list the sub-arguments of the
body paragraphs (although the introductory paragraph might <em>also</em>
do that). A strong thesis finds the connective tissue between all of the
body paragraphs, the larger thematic argument uniting the entire
essay.</li>
<li>There is nothing wrong with using the first person <em>per se</em>
(e.g. “I argue that…”), but this is not a venue for offering personal
opinions or perspectives, however interesting they might be. Rather, you
are attempting to persuade the reader to your interpretation of a common
body of evidence.</li>
<li>Note that the provided essay prompts are just that:
<em>prompts</em>. You still set the scope of your own essay, meaning
that it is perfectly fine to engage just part of the essay topic, or
extend beyond it, so long as that topic allows you to write a strong
essay per the above criteria. (In fact, you need not even mention which
prompt you are responding to in the heading: your parameters should be
clear from the essay itself.)</li>
<li>It is perfectly fine to advance an argument posited in lecture or an
assigned reading. Although creativity is of course encouraged, as a
criterion of evaluation, originality is a tertiary concern after
structure / argument / evidence and style.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-very-rough-rubric">A <em>Very</em> Rough Rubric</h2>
<ul>
<li>95-100: In addition to illustrating all the fundamentals of strong
essay writing, these essays do a little something extra, such as advance
an original argument or make innovative use of a source. Exceptionally
strong style can also make a difference above the 95 mark.</li>
<li>90-95: These essays have internalized all of the core fundamentals:
strong thesis; reflective engagement with a diverse source base; clear
structure.</li>
<li>80-89: Many of the fundamentals of analytical writing are present,
but something important is missing. Perhaps the thesis is vague. Perhaps
the source base is thin. Perhaps the paragraphs do not delineate clearly
defined topics.</li>
<li>70-79: These essays illustrate some degree of engagement with course
material generally, but not an appreciation of the genre of analytical
essay writing.</li>
