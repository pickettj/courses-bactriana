of a History Research Paper: Nuts and Bolts</h1>
<h3 id="front-matter">Front Matter</h3>
<p>The reader should immediately know who wrote the paper and what it is
about. You should not have a separate title page: real articles do not
have one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heading:
<ul>
<li>Title (and optional subtitle)
<ul>
<li>A common strategy is to make the main title short, evocative, and
pithy (or, best of all, featuring a pun!), followed by a longer, more
informative sub-title. But there is no rule or field standard.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Full Name</li>
<li>Affiliation
<ul>
<li>in a published article, this information would include institutional
affiliation and (possibly) title and email</li>
<li>for a university course paper, this should include:
<ul>
<li>the name of the course</li>
<li>semester</li>
<li>instructor name</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This section (which may or may not be designated with a sub-heading)
explains your major research questions and posits an argument-driven
thesis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first paragraph is the <em>hook</em>: draw your reader in with
exciting questions or an illustrative anecdote. (Historians over-use the
“cold open” approach, but when it works it works.)</li>
<li>The hook is followed by some kind of general discussion of your
major research questions.</li>
<li>The thesis should be obvious to the reader within the first three
paragraphs.</li>
<li>The length of the introduction depends on the length of the paper,
but for an article (usually around 20 pages, 10,000 words) one paragraph
for the intro will feel short and three pages will feel long.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="literature-review-historiography">Literature Review /
Historiography</h3>
<p>Most published papers do not have a formal historiography section
(instead integrating the discussion of the literature throughout the
paper or including it in the introduction), but it is a requirement for
many course papers.</p>
<p>By the time you sit down to write a research paper, the
historiography of your narrow field will seem obvious and natural to
you. But you have to <em>teach</em> your readers (even informed
readers):</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the major questions of this subfield of scholarship?
<ul>
<li>How do those questions relate to the concerns of larger fields? For
instance, if you are studying nationalism in the Russian Empire, how
does that sub-field relate to more theoretical scholarship about
nationalism as a phenomenon?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the most interesting debates, and how do they relate to one
another?</li>
</ul>
<p>A common (and understandable) mistake is to simply describe the
field, moving from one work to the next, organized into separate
paragraphs. Your job is to <em>make sense</em> of the field for your
reader, which means there is more of an <em>argument</em> implicit in
this section than may first meet the eye: you are making a case for how
the reader <em>ought</em> to understand the field. After all, with
hundreds, thousands of detailed publications advancing nuanced
arguments, you cannot possibly simply summarize them in a few
paragraphs. Inevitably, you are <em>curating</em> that information for
the readers, so better to be self-conscious and deliberate about it.</p>
<h3 id="body-paragraphs">Body Paragraphs</h3>
<p>A research paper can be divided into any number of sub-sections
(which may or may not have sub-headings). Usually a section is 2-5 pages
long. The important point is not how long the section is, but whether or
not it relates naturally to a sub-argument that relates to the larger
thesis of the paper. In other words, the reader ought to have a sense
not only of the topic that unites the sub-section, but the argument it
is advancing, and it should be clear how that smaller argument specific
to the section relates to the broader argument of the research
paper.</p>
<p>What is a paragraph? The purpose of a paragraph is not to structure
the white space on a page, although breaking up a wall of text is a
pleasant aesthetic side-effect. The paragraph is an
<em>organizational</em> convention. In a reseach paper, the first
sentence of the paragraph informs the reader of the general idea
organizing the rest of the paragraph. Quite often this sentence is an
argument of some kind. Then most, if not all, of the internal sentences
are positing facts in support of the general idea or sub-argument (which
means they need a citation: see below). Then the concluding sentence has
two responsibilities: to sum up the content of the paragraph, and also
to serve as a lead-in or bridge into the next one.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Time to wrap it up! The conlcusion is less standardized as a genre
than the preceding sections. At a minimum, you should rephrase and
restate the major arguments from the chapter. A strong, underused
strategy might be to do that in a paragraph or two and curtains close.
You might also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge and address weaknesses and possible criticisms of your
argument. Are there important sources you did not or could not examine?
What is the strongest counterargument to your conclusions?
<ul>
<li>This does not undermine your arguments: it strengthens them by
reassuring the reader that you were already compensating for potential
shortcomings and taking criticisms on board.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chart a path for future inquiry: how might you or other scholars
continue this line of inquiry?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="citations-notes-and-bibliography">Citations, Notes, and
Bibliography</h3>
<p>Every single factual assertion in the paper must be accompanied by a
citation. Every single one. This means that many body paragraphs will
have a citation associated with nearly every sentence.</p>
<p>Historians use <a
href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">Chicago
Style</a>. If you <a
href="https://courses.bactriana.org/policies/zotero">use Zotero</a>, all
you need to do is select Chicago for the stylesheet, and the app will
take care of the rest. If you are citing by hand, you are responsible
for correct formatting.</p>
<p>90% of historians strongly prefer footnotes over endnotes. If you are
writing a paper for a class, use footnotes.</p>
<p>If you are using full notes (instead of short notes), which you
should, then there is no need for a separate bibliography, strictly
speaking: all of the citation information is in the foontote itself.
Many journals therefore omit separate bibliographies because they take
up space, and space costs money. For a course paper, however, always
include a bibliography in addition to full footnotes. (Zotero can also
produce a bibliography for you automatically.)</p>
