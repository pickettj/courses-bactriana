<h2 id="grading-philosophy">Grading Philosophy</h2>
<p>What is a ‘good’ reason to miss an assignment or submit it late? What
is a ‘bad’ reason? Who decides? How can your instructor know? My grading
policies do not take a position one way or another about these
questions: as an instructor, I cannot directly assess whether something
was your ‘fault’ or not, only the outcome. Therefore, course assignments
are designed to maximize flexibility in order to give everyone the
benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2 id="the-upshot-flexibility">The Upshot: Flexibility</h2>
<p>If you miss an assignment or a class, in the vast majority of
scenarios there is already a policy in place: please read the syllabus.
Most essay deadlines have a “grace period” before which your grade will
not be penalized for late submission. Many other grade categories
automatically excuse the first several missing assignments or generously
round upward from a percentage cutoff. Check the syllabus for specifics:
90% of the time there is no need to contact the instructor.</p>
<h2 id="more-serious-situations">More Serious Situations</h2>
<p>In return for flexible deadlines and other flexible assignment
policies, I ask that you contact me only for personal matters so
significant that they are not covered by the standard policies. Usually
these situations are on scale of seriousness that we would need to
involve advisors, doctors, or other university personnel to discuss a
strategy for completing the coursework.</p>
<p>In short: for ordinary situations everyone faces over the course of
the semester (getting a cold, skipping class for a once-in-a-lifetime
concert, etc.) you are already covered and there is no need to contact
the instructor. If something comes up that prevents you from completing
coursework even beyond what the standard policies account for, we will
consult with your advisors and come up with a plan.</p>
