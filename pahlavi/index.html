                Language</h1>
                <h2 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>
                <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
                <p>Pahlavi (aka Middle Persian) is a little-studied
                Iranian language associated with the Sasanian Dynasty of
                Iran. At the risk of oversimplification, Pahlavi is ‚ÄúNew
                Persian‚Äù (itself not all that new, a term referring to
                the variety of Persian that began being written in
                Arabic script in the 10th century) as it existed without
                Arabic or Islamic influence.</p>
                <p>At the risk of understatement, Pahlavi is a
                Zoroastrian language. The surviving Pahlavi texts ‚Äî a
                corpus numbering in the thousands of pages (large
                compared to what survives in other archaic languages,
                but small compared to what you are probably used to) ‚Äî
                were preserved for posterity by refugee Zoroastrian
                priests, which means they are disproportionately
                religious in character. The same way it would be
                difficult to study classical Arabic with no knowledge of
                Islam, it is difficult to study Pahlavi as a language
                without also trying to understand the world of
                Zoroastrianism on its own terms.</p>
                <p>So we are going to try to learn about a language and
                culture very far removed from our own. If you are still
                interested, it is because you like doing things
                <em>because</em> they are hard, not despite the fact.
                Pahlavi as a language will have more features that seem
                punishingly difficult to master. Zoroastrianism as a
                tradition will have fewer common touchstones with
                anything you are familiar with. That is what makes this
                fun‚Ä¶ right?</p>
                <h3 id="texts">Texts</h3>
                <p>For the Pahlavi language, we will make it as far as
                we can through Oktor Skj√¶rv√∏‚Äôs <em>Pahlavi Primer</em>.
                This was written by the greatest master of everything
                Pahlavi of the 20th-21st century: it is comprehensive
                and challenging.</p>
                <p>Our other textbook is also by Dr.¬†Skj√¶rv√∏: <em>An
                Introduction to Zoroastrianism</em>. This text is
                similarly comprehensive and dense, so we will supplement
                it with other readings.</p>
                <p>You can find digital versions of the texts in the <a
                href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ts2s180hkb0l2ncps2b59/ALgpWy5eecBGe4XZVjUUKR4?rlkey=7vhh1fod8sgelrnus3mo9w0v4&amp;st=kw5r151w&amp;dl=0">course
