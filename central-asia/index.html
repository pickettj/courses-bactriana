                <h4 id="course-objective">Course Objective</h4>
                <p>Over the last several centuries, Eurasia’s
                millennia-long domination by successive nomadic steppe
                empires (stretching from Europe to China) was displaced
                by new imperial challengers from the periphery (notably
                Russia, China, and Britain). This course examines the
                nature of that transition by charting the history of
                Eurasian empires from the Mongols (thirteenth century)
                to the present day. From Genghis Khan to Tamerlane to
                Stalin; between Russian spies, Viking berserkers, and
                the Taliban; across silk roads, great games, and
                more.</p>
                <h4 id="organization-of-course-content">Organization of
                Course Content</h4>
                <p>The empires of the steppe were truly vast in scale,
                integrating territories usually studied in isolation
                from one another – and so this course provides important
                context for separate courses on Russian, Eastern
                European, Chinese, and Middle Eastern history. The
                chronological scope of this course is similarly epic,
                spanning over seven centuries, which will allow us to
                focus on recurring themes related to empires in world
                history. Our primary focus will be on geopolitical
                strategies for imperial rule, but we will also examine
                entangled cultural, religious, and economic themes along
                the way. The course will emphasize three lenses of
                historical analysis: institutions, ideology, and the
                broader geopolitical environment.</p>

                href="https://courses.bactriana.org/policies/learning-outcomes.html">Learning
                Outcomes</a></h4>
                <p>The principle learning outcomes of this course are
                twofold:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li>Ability to deploy original analysis through the
                engagement of primary sources</li>
                <li>The articulation of that analysis through
                evidence-based writing</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Both of these skills are developed in view of
                applying them beyond the academic field of history.</p>

                Canvas cutoffs apply, with one exception: only the two

                href="https://courses.bactriana.org/policies/grading.html">Absences
                and Makeup Work</a>:</strong> Course policies build in
                substantial flexibility. If you miss an assignment or
                class, existing systems accommodate you without separate
                communication needed. For extreme circumstances
                requiring additional accommodations beyond these
                policies, a note from your advisor is required.</p>
                <p><strong>Online Grading:</strong> All grading
                administered through Canvas, where you can check your
                status in real time. TopHat tracks point totals, but
                only Canvas grades count officially.</p>

                Silk Road</h3>
                <p><strong>Core Questions</strong></p>
                <p>Where is Central Asia, exactly, and what is the
                difference between all the different terms associated
                with it (e.g. Eurasia, Inner Asia, Transoxania, etc.)?
                How can we conceptualize steppe-sedentary relations? How
                did pastoral-nomadism originate? Was there one Silk
                Road, or multiple silk roads? Was Central Eurasia
                oriented more toward China, the Middle East, India, or
                Russia during the pre-Islamic period?</p>

                Uyghur empires)? Where did the Mongol advance falter and
                why? What was the role of empire in facilitating the

                across an entire continent?</p>

                <p><strong>Core Questions</strong></p>
                <p>Was there a Mongol “ideology”? If so, why did Mongol
                rulers convert to foreign religions, rather than convert
                local populations to their own? Is the Yuan dynasty
                better viewed as “Chinese” or nomadic? How do you assess
                the respective influences of Persian, Islamic, and
                Mongolian culture on the Ilkhanids? In what ways was
                Muscovy a successor state to the Mongol Empire? In what
                ways was it a successor state to the Kievan Rus (and to
                what extent can we speak of a “Kievan Rus”)? Was
                Tamerlane’s (Timur) empire the Mongol Empire
                reincarnated?</p>

                <p><strong>Core Questions</strong></p>
                <p>What were the core features of Islam, and
                Perso-Islamic high culture, during the early modern
                period? After millennia of serving as an underdeveloped
                tributary of nomadic empires, suddenly northwest Eurasia
                is conquering its former masters. How do you explain
                this momentous historical change? Was Nadir Shah’s state
                the last of the so-called gunpowder empires, or the
                first example of modern imperialism? Was there really a
                “Great Game,” and what was so great about it? How did
                Russian and Chinese imperial administrators make sense
                of the new nationalities they encountered? Why did China
                turn its imperial ambitions inland rather than toward
                the oceans?</p>

                <p><strong>Core Questions</strong></p>
                <p>Were there “nations” before the twentieth century? If
                so, how did they differ from our understanding today? If
                not, how do we understand pre-modern ethnicity? What is
                Islamic “reformism” or “modernism”? As a successor state
                to the Russian Empire, where did the Bolsheviks lose
                territory, and where did they hold it? Did they pick up
                any new territories? How do you explain the new
                boundaries of this polity? Would you consider the Soviet
                Union to be an “empire”? In the absence of communism,
                what positive programs and ideologies replaced it in
                China and the post-Soviet states? How do you explain the
                preoccupation with Islam in contemporary discourse about
                Central Eurasia?</p>
